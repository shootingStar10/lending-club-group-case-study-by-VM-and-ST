## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
A consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

In this project we have used EDA to analyze the influence of consumer attributes and loan attributes on tendency to default the loan.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The loan.csv dataset has been used for the analysis which contains the data of all the loans applied between 2007 and 2011.


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis: Applicants with annual income more than 100K+ have less likely to be charged off and with income less than 25K+ most likely to be defaulters.

- Conclusion 2 from the analysis: High Interest Rate loans have high chances of charge off

- Conclusion 3 from the analysis: Applicants who have taken loan for small business establishment purpose are most likely to be defaulter or charged off 

- Conclusion 4 from the analysis: Business should avoid giving loans applicants with higher bankruptcy record.
